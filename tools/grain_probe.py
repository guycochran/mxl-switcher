"""Grain-rate + uniqueness probe for the MXL demo health board (v2).

Why uniqueness and not just rate: every wedge species we've hit passes the
rate checks. A repeat-wedged reader delivers 30 buffers/s of the SAME frame
— head advances, grains tick, thumbnails refresh — and the only measurable
symptom is unique-frames/sec collapsing. (Found live 9/11: guest1 juddering
on program while every hop measured a clean 30fps; the selector's stale
reader was repeating frames at full rate.)

v2: PERSISTENT readers, one per flow, in a single pipeline — v1 attached a
fresh reader per sweep, and fresh attaches to the keyer flow deliver ~1/3
repeats while the encoder's long-lived reader is perfectly healthy (the
stale-attach artifact defaming a healthy keyer; proven with a browser-side
timecode-region measure reading 29.4 true fps). Persistent readers see what
the production readers see. Hashes CENTER scanlines (first 4KB of 1080p
v210 is under one scanline — letterboxed/keyed flows have static top rows).

Writes /mxl-domain/thumbs/grains.json every 3s with a rolling 3s window:
{name: {bps, ufps} | null}. Self-heals: if a flow reads nothing for >90s
the whole probe exits (runner respawns -> fresh attaches) — probes must
never be the thing that stays wedged.
