"""guest_slot_watcher — backend-free selector re-attach for the quickstart tier.

The live demo re-attaches the selector via the Express backend's /api/mxl/repair
when a guest flow appears. The quickstart has no backend. This watcher is the
self-contained equivalent: it polls the MXL domain for the fixed base flows plus
any Guest flows, and whenever the set of present flows CHANGES it re-issues the
selector's /pipeline/start (directly at :9604) with the current input list — so a
guest who connects a minute after boot becomes a live, cuttable slot hands-off.

Why a watcher and not pre-wiring: an idle guest flow cannot exist — rtspsrc 404s
with no publisher, so the guest-ingest pipeline only builds (and the flow only
appears) once a phone actually streams. Verified on a VM 2026-10-02.

Flow→UUID discovery uses mxl-info inside the input-selector container (same method
quickstart.sh uses). Stdlib only; runs on the bare host.

Env:
  SELECTOR_PORT     default 9604
  SELECTOR_CONTAINER default input-selector  (where mxl-info lives)
  MXL_DOMAIN        default /mxl-domain       (path inside that container)
  BASE_LABELS       comma list, always slots 0..N-1  (default "Pattern Video,Clip Video")
  GUEST_LABELS      comma list, appended as they appear (default "Guest 1,Guest 2")
  POLL_SECONDS      default 3
  PREFER_STABLE     "1" (default) to point a guest slot at its STABLE flow when
                    one exists; "0" to always use the volatile flow
  STABLE_SUFFIX     label suffix identifying a guest's stable flow (default " Stable")

STABILIZED SLOTS (folds in flow_stabilizer.py): a guest's RAW flow is recreated on
every reconnect (cellular drop, Larix stop/start), and on MXL v1.1.0 a recreated
flow permanently wedges every downstream reader — so without help the watcher must
re-attach the whole selector on each reconnect (which also reverts active-input).
flow_stabilizer.py fixes that at the source: it reads the volatile "Guest N" flow
and writes a "Guest N Stable" flow created once and never recreated, swapping only
its reader in-place. When such a stable flow is present this watcher wires THAT into
the slot, so a reconnect is invisible to the flow set → no re-attach churn, no cut
revert. Falls back to the volatile flow when no stabilizer is running, so this is
purely additive. Run a stabilizer per guest to get the benefit:
  flow_stabilizer.py guest1 <guest1-uuid> <guest1-stable-uuid> "Guest 1 Stable"
