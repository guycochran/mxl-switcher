"""Live WebRTC viewer counter + 24h traffic record for the MXL health board.

mediamtx's API is disabled (enabling = container recreate = viewer blip), but
its log narrates every session. Follow it, keep the open-session set and a
24h record of session opens (with source IPs), write thumbs/viewers.json
where mxl_thumbs merges it into health.json.

Ghost rule: sessions that die without a 'closed' line (e.g. during the 14:02
selector wedge) linger forever in the naive set — so alongside nominal `open`
we report `opened_10m`/`opened_60m` (recent-activity gauges) and drop opens
older than 6h from `open`. For "can I down the box" reads, trust opened_10m.

A restart replays 48h of log before following, so the 24h traffic record
survives restarts.
