"""Stable guest-slot semantics for guest_slot_watcher.

The bug this guards: when guests were appended only if present, an absent Guest 1 made
Guest 2 land on slot 2; when Guest 1 later connected, Guest 2 jumped to slot 3 — moving
an operator's / Companion's button under them. The fix is a FIXED-LENGTH slot list where
an absent guest's slot is held by a safe placeholder, so indices never move.
